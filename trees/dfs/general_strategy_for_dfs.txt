General Strategy fro DFS
==========================

Look at the global problem and express it as a local (per node) problem.

It should be plainly obvious how the local solutions will be combined to generate the global solution.

In order to compute the local solution, check whether a node needs information from its parent(above), or from its children(below). That will determine whether it is 
top-down DFS or bottom-up DFS.
